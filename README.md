# The Cookbook App  

The idea behind this project was to create an online cookbook app using python and either SQL or MongoDB.  
The main functionality of the app is to allow users to look up exsisting recipes, have the  
ability too add and edit existing recipes, and to delete any that were no longer requires.  

### UX  

A person using this app would want an easy and simple way to store recipes and retrieve the information  
so they could then either edit the information or use the recipe.  Because of this I decided  
to create a simple layout with clear links and buttons to add, edit or delete recipes.  
I also added the ability to sort recipes by name or the amount of upvotes it has to make finding  
the information easier. In regards to the design of the project I spent a few hours  
looking at other food websites and different colour schemes, this lead me to choose  
a lighter colour pallet and decide what information each recipe will need to include.  
I then created this [Wireframe](https://github.com/cball1990/cookbook-milestone/blob/master/wireframe.png) to workout the basic layout of the app and where information could be shown. 
I didn't change too much of the design ideas from the orginal wireframe and I think this is due to the  
research I did before embarking on this project.  

### Features  

#### Existing Features  

The main features of the app is the ability to add, edit, delete and look up recipes.  
Once you log into the app the main page has all the recipes displayed, you can sort  
the recipes by name or the amount of upvotes it has. Each recipe displayed also  
has a button that allows you to view more detailed information on the recipe,  
a button to edit the recipe and one to delete the recipe. When you go and view  
more inormation on the recipe there is also a feature that allows you to upvote  
the recipe by clicking a button. On the main page of the app I added a nav bar with  
only 2 links for home and for the add recipe feature, this take you to a form that  
allows you to add details for a recipe along with basic instructions on how to fill  
the form out.

#### Features for the future

A good feature that could be added is the ability to save recipes to your own recipes  
section under a my account page, this would allow people  to save their favourite recipes  
and not have to search through all the recipes to find the one they want again.  
Another feature that could be added is to only allow the person who published the recipe  
to edit or delete the recipe, this would stop people from deleteing everything.  
The third feature I would add in the future is when you view a recipe, you would  
be able to click a button that creates a shopping list of ingrediants for you.
